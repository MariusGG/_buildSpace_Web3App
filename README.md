# Web3 App with Solidity + Ethereum Smart Contracts

This was a _buildspace_ 2-week project Project learning some Solidity, write + deploy a smart contract to the blockchain, and build a Web3 client app to interact with my contract. 


Course details:

1. Write and deploy a smart contract to a local Ethereum network

Get local Ethereum networking running

Write our first smart contract in Solidity

Compile contract locally and run it

Store ðŸ‘‹ data on our smart contract

Deploy locally so we can start building the website

2. Build web3 app that connects to our wallet and talks to our smart contract

Setup a basic react app, setup Metamask

Deploy smart contract to a real testnet

Connect our wallet to our web app

Call the deployed smart contract from our web app

3. Update smart contract to randomly send lucky users some Ethereum

Storing messages/timeStamps from users on the blockchain

Fund contract, set a prize, and send users Ethereum
